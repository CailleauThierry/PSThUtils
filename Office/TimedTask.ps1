    Filename:		TimedTask.ps1
    Version:        1.1.2.9
    Started from: 	https://github.com/Windos/powershell-depot/blob/master/General/Timesheet.ps1
    ===========================================================================
    .DESCRIPTION
    This is a simple .csv timesheet generation.
	It record the beginning (when the script is launched) to end (when you select OK after entering the text) and calculate the duration between both in min
    You are meant to launch TimedTask.bat or TimedTask_vx.x.x.x.exe every time you want to make an entry to today's sheet 
    .EXAMPLE
    - Launch TimedTask.bat or TimedTask_vx.x.x.x.exe every time you want to record the time taken to perform a task. You can have multiple windows launched at the same time. Only press "Enter" / "OK" once the task is complete.
    .EXAMPLE
	- Pin TimedTask.exe to the Taskbar. Then if a TimedTask is already launched, just right click on it to launch a new one
	.FUNCTIONALITY
    - version 1.1.2.9 investigated a "field does not get written to file" issue with windows 10. I reproduce the same issue with wndows 10 seelp mode but only when the .csv was still opened in Excel
    Also created a path-check for the script to save to csv when the "\TimedTask_Logs" folder does not exist already
    - version 1.1.2.8 removes the requirement for TimedTask_v1.1.2.8.exe to "RunAsAdministrator" which is not required and makes for a nicer user experience. This is the ISESteroids Advanced application option "Close Console When Script Is done" only
	- version 1.1.2.7 Adding detection for "IT" keyword
	- previous idea for improvement "bring windows to front when the script starts (and still be able to fade to background...)" > not needed anymore, it work fine natively
	- version 1.1.2.6 creates a $profile/TimedTask_Logs folder to collect the files in that separate folder
    - version 1.1.2.5, small filtering changes same great functionnality
    - version 1.1.2.4, added a search keyword and some formatting
    - script now counts more than 60 min in version 1.1.2.3
    - TimedTask.ps1 version 1.1.2.1 autoupdates Category + TimedTask.exe (pinnable to taskbar)
    - TimedTask.ps1 based on Timesheet.ps1 but records beginning and end time instead. This is meant to be uses as launching a script for each tasks.
    - This version adds date-stamp to the generated .csv file
    - This version removes Type information in the generated .csv file (-NoTypeInformation)
    .NOTES
    - When editing in excel the double quotes generated by this script get removed for the csv > do not save the .csv after opening in Excel > maybe https://powershellreflections.wordpress.com/2012/06/15/my-adventures-with-powershell-and-charting-tools-2/
    - no need to check if timesheet already existing as it is date-tagged
       Ideas for improvement:
	- need to export filter criterias in an external configuration file
	- need to have multiple ticket # fitering
       Dropped Ideas:
	- Need a "Pause" button for each activities > Too much effort... ...better to create multiple entries to work pu the time deltas manually
	- Have a Gantt diagram view of the overlapping tasks even while editing > Too much effort... ...this would require native .NET C# programming for such a dynamic tool
	- Request from Leorry: It would be nice to be able to edit the main fields in the open window; Category,Ticket,Activity > Too much effort ... ..you can keep the generated .csv file in Notepad++. You can edit each coma-separated section - including the Category one – manually. You can also do some post-editing within Excel (even Excel online) that will help fill-in categories
